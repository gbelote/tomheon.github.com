_"Dennis developed the Unix operating system and the C programming language. So why should you care?"_  
_--Steve Jacks to the [Chicago Tribune](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-10-18/news/chi-111018jacks_briefs_1_vending-machine-unix-traffic-light)_

Walkers don't care too much who made their shoes  
If they're good shoes.  Dependence without thought  
Might be the truest form of gratitude,  
In that a craftsman is his work and not  
His name.  So while most people can't be bothered  
Mourning an engineer whose name they've never  
Heard before, they can't stop thanking you either,  
Whether they know your name or not: the silver  
Laptops they peck, the phones on which they yammer,  
The external nerves through which they know--these all  
Twiddle their bits to meaning through your grammar,  
Growing warm with your instructions.  If the soul  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exists, what can it be but information?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ghost performs the world's computation.
