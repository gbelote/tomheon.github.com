To see amid the capes and tentacles  
So many familiar masks and faces brings a swell  
Of something very much like justice  
To an old hero's heart.    
Except I'm such a lousy artist, I could draw  
Biographies for many of you--we go back that far.  
Aqua-Dog, The Sombrero, Princess Magma,  
Dr. Madness...Dr. Madness!?  How'd you get in here?  
Relax, friends, just a joke--a bad joke,  
Nothing more, relax.  The point,  
I hope, is taken, though.  While we convene, evil  
Spreads.  While we shake hands, it shakes its fists.  
While we pat backs, it...well, you get my drift.  Vigilance  
Must be forever our eternal watchword.  
My father told me, on the night he died, "A hero's just a man  
Who pays his own sins, then pays yours, and then says  
'Keep the change.'  Keep the change, son.  Keep...the..."  
I like to think he would be proud tonight  
To see me at this podium, holding this plaque  
Awarded for "Lifetime Achievement in Uniquely Abled Vigilantism,"  
The taxi-driver's scrawny son--a hero.  And yes, I know  
We're not supposed to use that word these days, but please  
Indulge an old man on his last night in the business.  In fact,  
I have a few words on the topic that I'd like...but ah,   
Here comes that music.  And anyway I'm done, except to say again  
Thank you to all of you for this, this honor, which will hang  
Prominently for all to see above the hearth of my secret base,  
Where, although I cannot reveal its location to anyone, each of you  
Would always find the hero's welcome all of you deserve.
