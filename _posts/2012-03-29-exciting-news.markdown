Many, many thanks to all of you who've read the book so far, and
doubly to those who've left reviews on Amazon or Goodreads, and triply
to those who have recommended the book to friends, strangers, or even
enemies.

If you enjoyed the book but haven't left a review or recommended it to
a friend, please consider doing so and claiming your double and triple
thanks right now!  We "indie" authors depend on readers to get the
word out there--without you we're just sending bits into the void and
pages into the can.

Over the next few days I'll be posting some details about the
experience people might find interesting: how I think the explosion in
sales happened, some of the data I've recorded in the meantime, and
some preliminary conclusions they suggest about e-book sales on Amazon
in general.

To those who've written to ask where the next book is: I'm working on
it!  Watch this space for news--you can subscribe by RSS or email over
on the right.

Thanks again, everyone.  More soon.
