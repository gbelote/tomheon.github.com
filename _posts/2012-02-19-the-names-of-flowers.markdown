"Petals," she says, and just like that "petals"  
Is nothing but an aching in your mind,  
Space desperate to be filled with real petals--  
Rose, tulip, sunflower--whatever kind  
You've seen, touched, smelled.  Try not to even think  
What else might go: your keys, the tickets--all  
Manner of footwear.  Continents could sink  
Without a ripple, constellations fall,  
Or antique gods bow low and exeunt,  
Mind right, at just her mention.  Does this power  
Stem from her cherished voice, or something different,  
More primal still--how just repeating "flower,"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flower," "flower," the words are not the same,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But three petals plucked from the single name?
