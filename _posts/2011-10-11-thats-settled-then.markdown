After a lot of editing, research, market testing, and some good old-fashioned hemming and hawing, I've made up my mind: <strong>I'm self-publishing Speculation before the end of this month.</strong>

And I'm putting this here, publicly, so that I have to hold myself to it.

Interested in finding out when it's available?  Head over to <a href="http://www.speculationbook.com">the website</a> and sign up to be notified.
