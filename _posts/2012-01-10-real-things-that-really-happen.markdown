Snow on roses.  The change of heart  
That fails to convince.  Even credit  
Where credit is due.  The time  
You ordered red wine and they brought you white,  
Which, to this day, is what you think you ordered.  
Just because they tell you stars  
Compose your body in a tone that turns  
Your stomach doesn't mean it isn't so,  
Nor does the astronomical improbability.  Wonders  
Within wonders take their numbers, wait,  
And happen, without bothering to check  
Against your schedule or your feelings.  Once  
Elephants stopped and shook their tusks  
Right where you are hanging your snowy coat.
