When my mother bought me my first bicycle,    
Beatrice hated me until she got her own.  She sulked    
The entire morning of my first communion,    
Refusing to eat that night.  While my mother    
Showed me how to fasten my first bra, Beatrice    
Frowned and postured, thrusting her own flat chest    
Out in the hopes that she might need one too.    
Two young sisters just like any others in the village.  And so    
    
When one day Beatrice came running, screaming    
In terror for my mother, I assumed she had become a woman,    
And I was ready to comfort and advise her.  Instead    
I saw her clutching fistfuls of one-thousand lire notes, more    
Sticking to her feet like toilet paper,    
More falling from her face like damp, dead leaves.    
The doctor said he'd never even read    
About a case like this.  To demonstrate, he pricked     
Her with a needle: how in her eyes the tears began as liquid,    
Turned to paper on her cheek, unclenching like a flower    
Along her chin, and fluttered to the ground.    
He showed us how the bills were salty,    
And kept the soggy pile as his payment.    
    
How I hated her then, "The Little Bank    
Of San Pietro dei Fiumi."  How I watched with envy    
As neighbors and old enemies, and even    
The mayor himself, arrived with hat in hand,    
Waiting hours in the parlor for an interview,    
Telling my sister all their hard-luck stories.    
"Without the operation, signorina, he will die."    
"Now, signorina, we have no roof, and next month come the rains."    
"Signorina, the piazza is a shame to all our village."    
All left with what they came for, smiling and bowing,    
Muttering "grazie, grazie" all the way out the door,    
Trying not to count too openly until they reached the street.    
My mother fed her pork and carrots boiled in milk,    
"To keep her strength up."  In one evening Beatrice    
Said no to six proposals, one from the mayor's son.      
She laughed and said that I could have my pick    
From those she had refused.  Then one day    
    
The Marini boy came running through the streets,    
Shouting to all the heads poked out their windows    
"The Euro is coming!  The Euro is coming!"    
Debate raged in the village: would Beatrice's eyes    
Make the switch with all the other banks?    
The visits became more numerous and desperate.      
No one was taking chances.  The mayor sent tenors,    
A troupe of them in shifts, to serenade her all night long    
With songs of shattered love.  They finished the piazza    
Just in time.  E-Day came and went, but my sister's tears--    
As I had known they would--remained Italian.    
The same brightly colored bills, the same    
Portrait of Maria Montessori.    
A few optimists tried to change some anyway,    
But were sternly told: "These serial numbers are too high."    
    
Last year my mother died, God keep her soul.    
My sister came to live with us.  Each night    
I hear her sobbing in the next room, and each morning    
I creep in before sunrise, careful not to wake her,    
Collecting all the bills around her head and pillow.    
I throw them in the piazza--paper tears that even    
The village beggars will not stoop to re-collect.
