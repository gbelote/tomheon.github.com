  <h1>This is a test header</h1>

  <p>Now I'm just going to put some basic content here, to see how things work. I'm hoping it'll look at least 50% as good
  as it does in my head, which is pretty sweet.</p>

  <p>Seems like there's some risk in this design in that if I don't get the right visual quality it'll look too cheesy and
  crappy. There's also the uncanny valley to worry about...</p>

  <p>All in all, though, I think it's work exploring. If it works it'll be really cool!</p>
